# National Park Species Analysis Proposal
Authors: Ngo Sy Trung & Doan Quang Hung

## 1. Dataset Description
We will analyze three datasets about US National Parks:
* **parks.csv**: 423 National Park areas with location, size, and type
* **species.csv**: 119,248 species records with taxonomy and conservation status
* **park_species.csv**: Links between parks and species

## 2. Reason for Selection
This dataset:
* Connects park features with biodiversity patterns
* Allows exploration of conservation priorities
* Provides geographic context to species distribution
* Supports analysis of environmental protection efforts

## 3. Research Questions
**Q1: How does species richness vary across different national parks?**
* We'll determine if park size, location, elevation, or ecosystem type affects biodiversity.

**Q2: What proportion of species are endangered, threatened, or of special concern?**
* We'll examine if rare species proportions relate to park type or geographic location.

## 4. Analysis Plan
**For Q1: Species Diversity Analysis**
* **Data Steps:**
   * Merge species and park data
   * Calculate biodiversity metrics per park
   * Extract environmental variables
* **Analysis:**
   * Correlate park size with species counts
   * Map geographic biodiversity patterns
   * Model factors influencing species richness
* **Visualization:**
   * Biodiversity heat maps
   * Size vs. species scatter plots
   * Park type comparison charts

**For Q2: Rare Species Analysis**
* **Data Steps:**
   * Identify conservation-status species
   * Calculate rare species percentages
   * Group by park types and regions
* **Analysis:**
   * Compare rare species percentages across park types
   * Identify geographic patterns of threatened species
   * Find predictors of conservation hotspots
* **Visualization:**
   * Rare species distribution maps
   * Park type comparison charts
   * Environmental factor correlation graphs

## 5. Additional Data
We will consider incorporate with those data:
* Climate change projections
* Surrounding land use patterns
* Visitor statistics
