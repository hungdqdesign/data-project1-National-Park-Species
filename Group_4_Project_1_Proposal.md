# National Park Species Analysis Proposal
Authors: Ngo Sy Trung & Doan Quang Hung

## 1. Dataset Description
We will analyze dataset from US National Parks:
* **most_visited_nps_species_data.csv**: 119,248 species records with taxonomy and conservation status from 15 most visited national park

## 2. Reason for Selection
This dataset:
* Connects park features with biodiversity patterns
* Allows exploration of conservation priorities
* Provides geographic context to species distribution
* Supports analysis of environmental protection efforts

## 3. Research Questions
**Q1: Does the species data from 15 most visited parks reflect the pyramid of number/biomass (Food chain pyramid)?**
* We'll determine if number of individual species observed reflect the food chain pyramid.

**Q2: What proportion of species are endangered, threatened, or of special concern?**
* We'll examine if rare species proportions relate to park type or geographic location.

## 4. Analysis Plan
**For Q1: Food chain Analysis**
* **Data Steps:**
   * Get species number of observable individuals
   * Match species category to food chain level
   * Graph scatter for analization
* **Analysis:**
   * Correlate park size with species counts
   * Map geographic biodiversity patterns
   * Model factors influencing species richness
* **Visualization:**
   * Biodiversity heat maps
   * Size vs. species scatter plots
   * Park type comparison charts

**For Q2: Rare Species Analysis**
* **Data Steps:**
   * Identify conservation-status species
   * Calculate rare species percentages
   * Group by park types and regions
* **Analysis:**
   * Compare rare species percentages across park types
   * Identify geographic patterns of threatened species
   * Find predictors of conservation hotspots
* **Visualization:**
   * Rare species distribution maps
   * Park type comparison charts
   * Environmental factor correlation graphs

## 5. Additional Data
We will consider incorporate with those data:
* Climate change projections
* Surrounding land use patterns
* Visitor statistics
